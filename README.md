## ID3 Reader
ID3 is the metadata specification for the MP3 audio format. ID3 details how metadata can be predictably stored in an MP3 file. There are two major versions of ID3: ID3v1 and ID3v2. These two versions differ dramatically. 

This application can read metadata of both ID3v1 and ID3v2 versions.
